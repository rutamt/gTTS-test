# Video Generation Application

This application allows users to generate videos based on input scripts. It utilizes various technologies to process the input script, convert it into speech, and generate a video with relevant visuals. Please note that the integration of ChatGPT is for demonstration purposes only and is not intended for actual usage.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: A Python web framework used for creating the application's backend.
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech): A Python library used to convert the generated script into speech.
- OpenAI ChatGPT: A language model developed by OpenAI. This project utilizes ChatGPT to demonstrate integration, but it is not intended for production use. [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/research/chatgpt) is cited as one of the technologies used.

## Usage

Please note that this project is for demonstration purposes only and is not intended for actual usage. The ChatGPT integration is unusable and serves as an example of how the technology can be integrated. Therefore, no instructions are provided for running or using the application.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own projects. Remember to refer to the official documentation of the technologies used for detailed instructions and guidelines.
